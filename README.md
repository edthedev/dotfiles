# dotfiles

My ~~Linux~~ dot files. These are shared so that I can easily share a link to a tip or trick.

## Setup

`bootstrap.ps1` - Script I use to setup on Windows. Mostly relies on Chocolatey, of course.
`bootstrap.sh` - Script I use to setup on Linux. Makes many decisions, as some of my Linux hosts are for targeted purposes.

## Installations

See `\install` for scripts to install various handy utilities. Most of these rely on `Apt` on Linux, or `Chocolatey` on Windows.

## Setups

See `setup` for configurations.
These are, obviously, just my preferred configurations.

In general, these work by setting up symlinks on Linux, and on Windows by copying a stub file that sources the versioned file.
